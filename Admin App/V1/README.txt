Make sure the file is in the same folder as Admin App V1

You have to enter the file extension along with the file name.

You can test it using this file, enter the file name "README" followed by the extension which is ".txt"
so in the input you should have "README.txt"

if you are unsure what the file extension for a certain file is then in file explorer, click "view"
at the top of the window then enable "file name extensions" by clicking the check box.
