Make sure the application or shortcut is in the same file as Admin App V2

You have to enter the file extension along with the file name.

You can test it using this file, enter the file name "README" followed by the extension which is ".txt"
so in the input you should have "README.txt"

if you are unsure what the file extension for a certain file is then in file explorer, click "view"
at the top of the window then enable "file name extensions" by clicking the check box.

if the file doesnt exist Admin App V2 will tell you and ask you to re-enter the file name.
